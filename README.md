# hirsgaertli.ch - My Personal Website

Hi! 👋🏼

This is the code of my personal website. Since I love markdown and I got to know a little bit of vue.js, I decided to build my website with [vuepress](https://github.com/vuejs/vuepress).

## What I did 👨‍💻

I did create a custom theme, following the great documentation at [vuepress.vuejs.org](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/theme/writing-a-theme.html). I also integrated vuetify, following these steps on [vuetifyjs.com](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/getting-started/installation/). Furthermore I installed the [@vuepress/blog](https://vuepress-plugin-blog.ulivz.com/guide/)-Plugin, which allowed me to easily transform my vuepress site into a blog by generating pages and routes. 

## Check it out 🚀

```bash
npm i
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Thank you 👏🏼
